Comparison Of Performance and Efficiency Of  Backend Frameworks: Spring Boot and Express.js
## This project aims to compare the performance and efficiency of two popular backend frameworks:

* Spring Boot (Java-based, widely used for enterprise-grade applications)
* Express.js (JavaScript-based, lightweight, and commonly used with Node.js)
* The goal is to evaluate the two frameworks on the following metrics:

## Language Used
### JAVA
### JavaScript
### MySQL
### Rest API's

### * Request/Response Handling Time
### *Resource Consumption (CPU, Memory)
### *Scalability
### *Ease of Use and Developer Productivity
### *Support for Asynchronous Processing
# Technologies used
## Spring Boot

###  I put together a summary of the results of the performance benchmarking tests. With this outcome in general, these results do provide somewhat clear insight both into
### Spring Boot and Express.js, Then in on pros and cons compared across all metrics tested: request handling capacity, response time, memory usage and CPU utilization.
